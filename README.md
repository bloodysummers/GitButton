# GitButton
GitButton is a **desktop git client** with the purpouse of being super-simple to use. It allows you to add all the git projects that you want, view the files changed and the log of your project.

But the most important feature is that it allows you to commit your changes with the push of a button (a psychical button, if you want).
Right after adding your project to GitButton, you can choose the action(s) that you want to do when pressing the big red button.

Just code and press the button. You can fetch, commit and even push, everything in one step.
